The shapeless feelings deep that I possess to cherish forever
I just deleted the templates in my mind to clear my heart
I caught this little phrase that flew by and put it inside my heart
And put my intimate words to sing and shout it out to break through the sky

It's all the things I share and bear with your heart
It's all the things to shout and send to your heart
Then all the dots combine into one line and
They echo faraway across the distance

It's all the words to share and bear with your heart
It's all the notes to shout and send to your heart
Then all the lines combine into a circle
Comes down to one to tell your world
It's here and everywhere

The crystal clear light that fills the air it always resembles you
Voices slipping through the fingers that I held toward the light
I felt this rhythm through my fingers moving and it came suddenly
Grasping all the words I could find and

Shout it out to break through the sky
It's all the things to share and bear with your heart
It's all the things to shout and send to your heart
Then all the dots combine into one line and

They sing throughout the sky, beyond the distance
It's all the words to share and bear with your heart
It's all the words to shout and send to your heart
Then all the lines combine into a circle
Comes down to one to tell your world

It's here and everywhere
Never doubted the days the sound that I played
I always thought the morning light
It was such an easy gift that will

Come and simply pour and rain on me
But still the sound that came and make me believe
It would shake my atmosphere
Tell your world today

The sound inside within your heart
It's all the things to share and bear with your heart
It's all the things to shout and send to your heart
Then all the dots combine into one line and
They echo faraway across the distance
It's all the words to share and bear with your heart
It's all the words to shout and send to your heart
Then all the lines combine into a circle
Comes down to one to tell your world
It's here and everywhere
